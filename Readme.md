# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project involves predicting diseases using a medical dataset. The main components of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format.
- **Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models for prediction.
- **Predictive System**: Implementing a system to make predictions based on the input data.
